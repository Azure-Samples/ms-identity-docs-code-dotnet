/*
This is an Azure Function that responds at GET /api/greeting.

Using the built-in authentication and authorization capabilities (sometimes
referred to as "Easy Auth") of Azure Functions, offloads part of the authentication
and authorization process by ensuring that every request to this Azure Function has
an access token. That access token has had its signature, issuer (iss), expiry
dates (exp, nbf), and audience (aud) validated. This means all that is left to
perform is any per-function authorization related to your application.
